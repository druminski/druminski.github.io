From time to time I like to watch a good movie. Not necessarily a new one. They are broadcasted in TV but finding them
can be a little tricky. Especially nowadays where there is plenty of tv channels and a lot of content which I am not interested in.

To find a good movie in TV you can jump between channels or you can read a tv guide.
Unfortunately those methods can be time consuming and discouraging.

So recently I decided to write an application which recommends the best movies broadcasted in TV.
The application is available here [http://movies-tonight.com](http://movies-tonight.com).
Currently it supports only Polish TV guide but if you would like to have support for other country then please let me know.

The idea behind the application is simple: scan some tv guide and recommend only movies which have high score
according to some popular movies database. As for a movies database, I decided to use [filmweb](http://filmweb.pl), because
it is the most popular one in Poland.

Filmweb mobile application also has a feature for recommending movies, but it works based on your previous ratings,
so you can miss some movies. Beside that, you need to install it and have an account.
